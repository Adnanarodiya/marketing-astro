## 📖 Product Content Brief

### 1. Product Positioning
* **Product Name**: Pontora
* **One-Line Positioning**: Pontora is a multi-tenant operations platform for trustee firms, companies, site managers, and employees to manage workforce administration, documents, tasks, approvals, timesheets, receipts, and daily business operations from one secure workspace.
* **Short Description**: Pontora brings company administration, employee records, trustee collaboration, digital documents, task management, timesheets, accounting documents, receipts, and operational workflows into one connected platform. It is built for organizations that need structured employee management, trusted external oversight, location-based operations, and clean digital records without scattered spreadsheets, email threads, or disconnected tools.
* **Long Description**: Pontora helps businesses and trustee firms run day-to-day administration with more control, visibility, and accountability. Companies can manage employees, locations, documents, tasks, forms, billing, timesheets, receipts, creditors, and business settings from a central company workspace. Employees get a focused self-service area to complete onboarding, manage their profile, upload documents, submit forms, track tasks, and handle time-related workflows. Trustee firms can manage client companies, assign internal team members, create approval tasks, review operational records, and support companies through a dedicated trustee workspace.
  
  The platform is designed around real organizational roles instead of generic user accounts. A company admin, employee, site manager, trustee admin, and trustee team member each sees the workflows that matter to them. This keeps daily work focused while preserving organization-level governance, auditability, and access control.

### 2. The Problem Pontora Solves
Modern businesses often run critical administration across too many disconnected tools:
* Employee data lives in spreadsheets.
* Documents move through email and manual folders.
* Tasks and approvals are hard to trace.
* Time, vacation, and working-hour rules are tracked separately.
* Receipts, creditor invoices, and restaurant/gastro daily revenue records are not connected to operational context.
* Trustee firms support companies through back-and-forth communication instead of structured workflows.
* Site managers need local visibility without receiving unrestricted company admin access.

Pontora solves this by creating one structured operating system for business administration. Each user works from the right role-based panel, and every module connects back to the organization, location, employee, and trustee context.

### 3. Role-Based Workspaces & Target Audience

* **Company Admin Workspace**: The operational command center for a company. Includes dashboards, employee management, documents, forms, tasks, timesheets, gastro management, receipts, creditors, notifications, billing, company settings, and trustee collaboration.
* **Employee Workspace**: A focused self-service area for personal employment workflows: onboarding profile completion, document uploads, forms, assigned tasks, timesheets, and notifications.
* **Trustee Admin Workspace**: Supports firms managing multiple client companies. Allows managing the firm, client company assignments, approvals, and trustee-specific notifications.
* **Trustee Team Member Workspace**: Scoped by the trustee organization to support assigned client companies with approvals, tasks, and document reviews.
* **Site Managers**: Location-specific access to handle local tasks and operational workflows without full company-level control.
